The Snake Game offers fertile ground for exploration 
in artificial intelligence (AI) and reinforcement learning. Here, agents are tasked 
with mastering decision-making, navigating the grid with finesse, and optimizing 
gameplay for high scores.

At the core of this adventure lies the Q-learning algorithm, a fundamental tool in 
reinforcement learning. Through Q-learning, agents learn to link actions with 
expected rewards, refining their strategies through trial and error. As they traverse 
the Snake Game's terrain, agents gain insights into optimal decision-making, 
honing their skills to tackle the game's dynamic challenges.
